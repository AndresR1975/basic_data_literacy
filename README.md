# basic_data_literacy

This project has the objective of showing the basic scope for data analysis for an Innovation consulting client. It uses two data sets of youtube and tiktok users and combines both data sets to provide an example of how to make numerical and categorical inferences.

This script was used to record a video that walks them through what needs to be done around data management and preparation, and how to align the data collected with business goals.

Process:
1. Loading data and libraries
2. Create new variables in the datasets to be ready for a join function
3. Convert string variables showin numbers into float variables
4. Joining datasets
5. Reclassify categorial missing values into "Undefined" new category
6. Fulling numerical missing values using histogram plot to find the best alternative
7. Dummy variables creation
8. Running an OLS regression example
9. Running a Classification Logistic regression model example
10. Showing the Confusion Matrix
